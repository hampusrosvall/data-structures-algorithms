# Introduction 

Implementing various algorithms and data structures in Python for personal education purposes. 

# Content 

Every Python module contains a thorough description of the time complexity of each algorithm/method in data structure respectively. 
Moreover, every file contains a main script where some simple test cases are tested to verify the proper functionality of each implementation. 

## Algorithms 

### Graph algorithms

* Breadth first search 
* Depth first search 

## Data Structures 

### List data structures 

* Singly linked list 
* Doubly linked list
