# Introduction 

Implementing various algorithms and data structures in Python for personal education purposes. 

# Content 

Every Python module contains a thorough description of the time complexity of each algorithm/method in data structure respectively. 
Moreover, every file contains a main script with some simple test cases to verify the proper functionality of each implementation. 

## Algorithms 

### Graph algorithms

* Breadth first search 
* Depth first search 

### Recursion

* Fibionacci sequence (memoized and non memoized)

## Data Structures 

### List data structures 

* Singly linked list 
* Doubly linked list 
* FIFO queue
* LIFO queue (stack)

### Tree data structures 
* Binary search tree - recursive implementation 
* Binary search tree - iterative implementation 

# Running the code 

Simply clone down the repository and run the following line `python3 <name_of_folder/name_of_script.py>` in your terminal in order to run any provided file.
